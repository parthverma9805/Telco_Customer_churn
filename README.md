# Telco_Customer_churn

ðŸš€ Task 2 @ Future Interns â€” Customer Churn Prediction

Thrilled to share my second project at Future Interns: building a machine learning model to predict which customers are likely to leave a service.

What I built

A classification pipeline (Logistic Regression & XGBoost, with cross-validation and probability calibration)

Feature engineering on tenure, contract type, payment behavior, service usage, and support interactions

Explainability via SHAP to surface top churn drivers

A Power BI dashboard with churn probabilities, segment drill-downs, and cohort views

Tools: Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost), Matplotlib, Power BI

Deliverables & Outcomes

ðŸ“¦ Scored churn probabilities for every customer (ranked risk list for retention teams)

ðŸ“Š Insights dashboard highlighting high-risk segments & key drivers

ðŸ’¡ Business recommendations, e.g.:

Target proactive outreach for month-to-month, high-support-ticket users

Bundle security/backup add-ons for DSL users with low tenure

Offer incentive plans before contract renewal windows

Simplify payment flows to reduce churn correlated with failed/late payments

If youâ€™d like a walkthrough or want to try the notebook/dashboard on your data, happy to connect!
